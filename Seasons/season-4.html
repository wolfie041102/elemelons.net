                <strong>Gender:</strong> Male</br>
                <strong>Divine:</strong> Yes</br></p>
                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>As one of the main 3 gods, Hades is one of the most powerful divine beings. He is the god of the dead, and king of the underworld. His purpose in this universe is unclear, but he has a massive kingdom he rules over together with his wife, Persephone. Hades is not reckless, and doesn’t kill without reason. When mortals ask him for a favor, he will ask for something back, or a way for the mortals to prove they are worthy of his favor. He does not like unwanted visitors in the underworld, and won’t treat them kindly.</p>
                <h5>First appearance:</h5>
                <p>Hades is first seen under the name ‘Proteus’ as one of Phobos’s guards, together with Alyx. As described before, they plan on taking him down when he is at his weakest. After that, they will retreat to the underworld for a while to gain power and come up with his next move.</p>

                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>Chymes is an alchemist better than anyone has ever seen. His alchemy skills are unmatched and his reputation mysterious. He seems to like experimenting on others, especially Skye.</p>
                <h5>Backstory:</h5>
                <p>In his younger years, Chymes worked for a king in a successful kingdom. He would cure any sickness, and supply the entire army with things that made them unstoppable. But this wasn’t enough for Chymes. He wanted more power, more succes. So he started experimenting on humans. When the King found out, he exiled Chymes. Mysteriously, the entire kingdom died that year from a mysterious disease. Ever since then, Chymes has worked for his own.</p>
                <h5>First appearance:</h5>
                <p>Chymes will first be seen alongside Skye, experimenting on her.</p>

                <strong>Gender:</strong> Female</br>
                <strong>Divine:</strong> Yes</br></p>
                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>Persephone is the Goddess of spring and vegetation, Hades’ wife, and queen of the underworld. Formerly known as Kore, but no one calls her that, for good reason. For a long time many people worshipped her, but now they barely remember. However, she’s planning on making them remember. She rules besides Hades, and has about as much to say about the land as Hades himself, but prefers to leave any cases regarding mortals up to him. She is a kind and gentle person but when insulted, she  will make sure the person gets punished in cruel ways. When her power is challenged she doesn’t take this lightly or kindly. She is not easy to reason with, unlike hades.</p>
                <h5>First appearance:</h5>
                <p>She will first be seen living on her own, not socializing a lot, but when needed or wanted. When Hades and Helen execute their plan, she’s eager to join them in the underworld, to restore her full power and status, and rule as queen.<p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> about 532, appears 21</br>
                <strong>Gender:</strong> fluid but prefers she/they pronouns</br>
                <strong>Divine:</strong> No</br></p>
                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>Though Echo might appear a bit frightening because of their contrasting hair and eyes and burn scar that runs from their left cheek to their shoulder, they're a very kind and caring soul. They give off cozy and mother-like vibes. They're always prepared to help those in need but don't hurt anyone who's dear to them. You don't want to end up like the fools befor you who have. Dead.</p>
                <h5>First appearance:</h5>
                <p>Echo will most likely first be spotted with animals or food, they're a lover of nature, what can I say.</p>
                <h5>Echo - Hades relation</h5>
                <p>When she was young, Echo lost her parents when her village went up in flames. Hundreds of people died, and Echo was one of few remaining. Running around in panic and grief, she lost control of her shape shifting abilities. That’s when Hades walked up to her. Hades was there because of the huge amount of deaths, and as god of the dead, he had to take a look. When Hades saw her ability, he knew she was special. Because Hades didn’t want others to abuse her for her powers, Hades decided to take her in as his own. Ever since then, Hades and Persephone have been as parents to Echo.</br></br>
                When Echo was a bit older, she got raped. It didn’t take long for Hades to find out, and when he did he made sure that he got damned for eternal torture in the underworld. However, Echo was already pregnant. When she gave birth to Char’s great grandmother, she quickly realized that she didn’t have the strength to raise a child, and gave her away to two others.</p>

                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>Char is a very bubbly and childlike person, but can also be annoyingly stubborn. She likes to work in the garden and especially likes to grow flowers. Because of this she often wears overalls and crocs.</p>
                <h5>Backstory:</h5>
                <p>Char grew up in a very small and isolated village. She does not have a last name because the village got rid of them a long time ago. This is because if all the men would transfer their last name to their children the whole village would have the same last name. To hide the incest they got rid of the evidence.</br>
                Char wanted adventure and just told her parents she was going away for a bit. They were fine with it and very supportive.
                She also uses Echo's last name when asked for one.</p>
                <h5>First appearance:</h5>
                <p>She comes walking with her backpack and crocs, excitement in her step. She happily introduces herself and can't wait to build her own home.</p>

                <p>(From Skye perspective)</br></br>
                It was an average day, about as average as any other day inbetween non-mannered nomads. And yet again, I was bored. The adults thought I was too young to be part of the council, the kids thought I was too old to play with them... so I went exploring. Upon exploring, I found a cave. Unlike most caves however, this one was home to an Alchemist. The potions smelled so sweet, and the mist coming off of the cauldrons looked so magical... I HAD to speak with the Alchemist. One insane conversation led to another... and he forced experiments on me... the worst thing? I liked it. I loved the feeling of power... the enchancements the potions granted me, the stories of perfect materials and beings that could never die... He tried his newest potion on me, and everything went dark... but hot. I thought I was dead, but the truth was worse. I woke up in my village due to screams... I smelt the burning of the tents and the skin of my friends... I’ll never forget that smell...</br></br>
                Between all the people running and screaming, a mysterious figure stood still, with the looks of death itself, and a stare that could freeze the fires. It looked me straight in the eye, and spoke to me. “I know this isn’t your fault, and I will not blame you for it. I’ve met another girl in the same situation as you. I’ll bring you to her. I’ll take care of you, you’re safe”.</br></br>
                I killed my tribe while under the influence of a potion... no one can find out about this... but neither do I want to stop experimenting</p>

                <h5>Description:</h5>
                <p>Alyx was the outcast of the group she traveled with. The others used to make plans without telling her, and do things without involving her. When Hades met Alyx, he saw potential in her for power. Hades offered her a place by his side as guard, in trade for her soul. Ever since then, Alyx is Hades’ most trusted guard, and is as family to him. She has Hades’ back, because she knows he has hers.</p>
                <h5>First appearance:</h5>
                <p>Alyx is first seen as one of two guards for Phobos, with the other guard being Hades in disguise. However, She and Hades plan on taking Phobos down, because of a deal Hades made.</p>

            <h2>Motives</h2>
            <h3>Hero Motivation: Echo Robulet-Dagon</h3>
            <p>Echo’s reason for being the hero is out of revenge. She was very close to Phobos, and it hurt her a lot when he got killed. She found out that Huxley was the cause of Phobos’ death, and now she wants to end Huxley’s life as revenge.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Villain motivation: Huxley</h3>
            <p>Huxley got abused and betrayed over and over again by his parents and family. But after a while, he found a friend, Phobos. Huxley and Phobos were very close, and Phobos promised to protect Huxley from Hades. When Huxley eventually got attacked by Hades, Phobos was nowhere to be seen. This was the last drop for Huxley, and he went insane. Out of hopelessness Huxley sold his soul to Hades, so that Hades would kill Phobos. After he did, Huxley kept going in a downwards spiral, and wouldn’t stop until he dies.</p>

            <h5>Immortal: Hades</h5>
            <p>There is an immortal that is only killable with special weapons that they get to choose themselves. The immortal has 1 specific weapon, so not all special weapons will work on all immortals. The immortals get to choose what to do with their own weapon, wether to hide it somewhere and make a story around it, or keep it in their own possession, or lost.</p><br><br>
            <h5>Mind control: Persephone</h5>
            <p>When the mind controler tells someone to do something (in a way they get to decide), the victim HAS to listen, unless specified differently.</p><br><br>
            <h5>Shape shifting: Echo Robulet-Dagon</h5>
            <p>The shape shifter can turn into any animal (or person!) at any time, but it will exhaust them. She does the shape shifting by telling people around her that she is in a different form, and they have to act accordingly</p><br><br>
            <h5>Necromancer: Char</h5>
            <p>The necromancer can communicate and interact with people that are canonically dead. (And maybe resurrect?)</p><br><br>
            <h5>Alchemic manifestation: Skye</h5>
            <p>The Alchemic manifestor is experimented on by the Alchemist. This has left them with some permanent side effects, these are: making others hallucinate, feel the precense of objects, or making people feel pain or other sensations.</p>
